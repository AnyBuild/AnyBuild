# Contributing to AnyBuild
This project welcomes contributions and suggestions. Most contributions require you to agree to a Contributor License Agreement (CLA) declaring that you have the right to, and actually do, grant us the rights to use your contribution. For details, visit https://cla.microsoft.com.

When you submit a pull request, a CLA-bot will automatically determine whether you need to provide a CLA and decorate the PR appropriately (e.g., label, comment). Simply follow the instructions provided by the bot. You will only need to do this once across all repos using our CLA.

The Code of Conduct this project has adopted is described in: [CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Submitting Pull Requests

- **DO** ensure your contribution has associated unit tests.
- **DO** ensure submissions pass all Azure DevOps Pipelines phases and are merge conflict free.
- **DO NOT** submit build engine features as PRs to this repo first, or they will likely be declined.
- **DO** submit issues for features. This facilitates discussion of a feature separately from its implementation, and increases the acceptance rates for pull requests.
- **DO NOT** submit large code formatting changes without discussing with the team first.

When you are ready to proceed with making a change, get set up to build the code (see [README](README.md)) and familiarize yourself with our developer workflow. 

These two blogs posts on contributing code to open source projects are good too: [Open Source Contribution Etiquette](http://tirania.org/blog/archive/2010/Dec-31.html) by Miguel de Icaza and [Don’t “Push” Your Pull Requests](https://www.igvita.com/2011/12/19/dont-push-your-pull-requests/) by Ilya Grigorik.

## Creating Issues

- **DO** use a descriptive title that identifies the issue to be addressed or the requested feature. For example, when describing an issue where the system is not behaving as expected, write your bug title in terms of what the system should do rather than what it is doing – “AnyBuild should statically predict MSVC c1xx.dll on Windows.”
- **DO** specify a detailed description of the issue or requested feature.
- **DO** provide the following for bug reports
    - Describe the expected behavior and the actual behavior. If it is not self-evident such as in the case of a crash, provide an explanation for why the expected behavior is expected.
    - Provide example code that reproduces the issue.
    - Specify any relevant exception messages and stack traces.
- **DO** subscribe to notifications for the created issue in case there are any follow up questions.
